Basically I bought an ART X-11 MIDI MASTER pedal board hoping that I could control my guitar effects with it using Controller Commands.
Turns out it only sent Channel Change when I pressed a button, and a sysex message when I depressed it. >_<
So I wrote this piece of software to fully utilize its potential.
